        <h4>Life and Health Update</h4>
        <h5>Apr 9, 2025</h5>
        <p>I'm currently a month into a chronic gastro-colitis with symptoms of gastroesophagal reflux disease (GERD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It's the first time in my life that a condition like this one has lasted this long. Then again, I'm almost 31 years old; I guess it was a little foolish of me to expect my health to be the same as, say, 10 years ago. I'm well aware (moreso now) that I can't just be eating the same stuff I used to when I was in my 20's.</p>
        <p>While I'm not quite sure exactly which of my habits led to this moment, surely I could list a few. Granted, the food I eat at home is balanced, nutritious, healthy and with good portions. However, there's a word in Spanish that describes me pretty well in its intended sense: "antojado". Even if I eat healthy at home, I sometimes have a hard time resisting evening cravings of more hearty/heavy meals, such as tacos and the like. Also, I am a big fan of spicy foods.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>I guess all of this has to change now, huh?</p>
        <p>On the bright side, I'm feeling a little better now. My colon inflammation and bloating has been feeling lighter for the past two or three days, which makes me happy since that was the only symptom that seemed not to get better during all this time. The only downside is I'm now dealing with reflux (which decides to make a comeback just now, when my other symptoms improved, lol). The treatment for reflux alone is different than the one for colitis. Fortunately, I think I know what to do now in that regard. What I want the most, though, is for the colon inflammation to go away entirely, and it finally looks like I'm on that path. Wish me luck :)</p>

        <h4>How my Weekend Was</h4>
        <h5>Apr 9, 2025</h5>
        <p>Last Sunday, in the early morning, I met my friend Daniel. We were originally supposed to go for breakfast together, but given my current medical condition, we went to a coffee shop instead. Don't worry, I didn't get coffee, but rather chamomille tea sweetened with honey. I was actually pleasantly surprised that <em>that</em> place offered tea as an alternative; I'd never really paid attention to their menu before, but now that I think about it, what kind of coffee shop wouldn't sell tea? Haha.</p>
        <p>For about two hours, we talked about what's currently going on in our lives. It felt refreshing to finally have the energy to go out again after a long time.</p>
        <p>Before arriving at the coffee shop, I visited the school I went to as a child (we're talking elementary/junior high); it was just around the corner. I parked my car on the curbside, and there was pretty much no one around since, well, it was a Sunday after all. Elementary school was a good time for me (junior high not so much), so going back there after almost 20 years somehow made me feel peaceful. It felt like a full circle moment.</p>
